# Wait But Why

- [Deployed Site](https://ayoungdrew.github.io/wait-but-why/)
- [Front-End Client Repo](https://github.com/ayoungdrew/wait-but-why/)
- [Heroku App](https://wait-but-why-api.herokuapp.com/)


The planning process started out with me thinking on what I could improve on from what I learned with my Life Soundtrack project which greatly benefitted from the handlebars component system that Ember also employs. I figured another journaling/blogging type app would be fun to explore.

I quickly realized that this could easily segue into building an app with a social media aspect to it which was exciting as it could continue blossoming into a bigger project for me in the future. A big aspect was getting the database right. I was rusty on rails so sought youtube to get a refresher. Luckily it turns out blog posts and comments are a problem people solve often. Taking advice from my instructors this time I choice to aim for mostly MVP requirements first, so CRUDing functionality for event resources came first.

Getting a handle on how EmberJS set up resource relationships and attribute types was a big hurdle and slowed me down quite a bit. While I had aspirations to incorporate some extra front-end packages like D3 and CSS animation libraries I had to prioritize basic UI functionality to reach MVP in time. All in all a successful process and great learning experience
